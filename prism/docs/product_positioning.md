# Prism — Product Positioning

## Owner

Product/Demo Lead.

## Purpose

Short product positioning for Prism: what it is, who it’s for, and how it’s different. Used for demo narrative, README, and judge-facing pitch. No implementation.

---

## What It Is

Prism is a browser extension plus a lightweight backend that analyzes the page you’re reading and returns **structured perspective expansions**—different framings or viewpoints on the same content—plus optional **bias indicators** and a **reflection prompt**. The goal is to make “see other angles and pause to reflect” a natural part of reading on the web.

---

## Who It’s For

- Readers who want to challenge their default framing without leaving the page.
- Educators or facilitators who want to prompt reflection and critical thinking.
- Hackathon judges and stakeholders evaluating “better information consumption” or “media literacy” ideas.

---

## How It’s Different

- **Lightweight:** Extension + small backend; no full app or new reading destination. Fits into existing behavior.
- **Structured:** Output is not free-form summary but labeled perspectives and optional bias/reflection, so the UI can stay consistent and experiment-friendly.
- **Modular:** Built so we can emphasize different experiments (perspective matrix, bias scoring, source comparison, reflection mode) without rewriting the core. One codebase, multiple demo directions.

## One-Liner

“Prism analyzes what you’re reading and shows you multiple perspectives and a reflection prompt—so you don’t have to read in a single frame.”

---

## Tagline Options

- “Multiple perspectives. One click.”
- “See the angles before you decide.”
- “Read. Reflect. Repeat.”

Use in README, demo script, or slide deck as needed.
